<h2>Education</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from Forest Lake High School in the class of 2011 and went on to attend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started sports as an early age starting soccer when I was in first grade and continuing until 8th grade. From 7th to 12th grade in High School I played tennis and
